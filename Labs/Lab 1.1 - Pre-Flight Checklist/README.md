# Lab 1.1 - Pre-Flight Checklist: Setting Up GitHub Copilot and your repository

Compare this to "Preparing Your Travel Itinerary, Checking Passport, Printing Boarding Pass". Just as travelers plan their journey, participants will set up their GitHub repository, planning their coding journey. In this Hands-On Lab, you will learn how to navigate GitHub, create a new issue and obtain your own GitHub repo with the code for these hands-on labs. You will be working on your own repo in the following labs.

## Estimated time to complete

- 10 min

## Objectives

- Getting familiar with GitHub Codespace
- Set up a Codespace for your repository with specific extensions and configurations.
    - Step 1: What is a codespace?
    - Step 2: Create a codespace in your repository
    - Step 3: Verify Copilot Functionality
    - Step 4: Verify the application runs (Optional)
    - Step 5: Verify calling the REST API (Optional)

You can then use this codespace to work on the exercises in the Hands on Labs. ðŸ”¨

### Step 1: What is a codespace?

GitHub Codespaces is a feature that allows you to code directly in the browser. It is a cloud-hosted development environment that you can access from anywhere. It is a fully featured development environment that can be used to develop, build, and debug your applications. It is based on Visual Studio Code, so you get all the features of Visual Studio Code, including extensions, IntelliSense, and debugging.

- GitHub hosts each Codespace in a Docker container on a virtual machine, with options ranging from 2 to 32 cores, 8 to 64 GB RAM, and 32 to 128 GB storage. Codespaces default to an Ubuntu Linux image with common languages and tools, but you can customize this with any Linux distribution to meet your specific needs.

### Step 2: ðŸ’» Create a codespace in your repository

- First, we are going to create a plain vanilla Codespace that you will use throughout this bootcamp.

Navigate to your own repository on the URL https://github.com/Technical-Bootcamp/attendee-[yourhandle].

- Locate the `Code` tab near the top menu.
- Click the green `Code` button, then click on `Codespaces`, click the 3 ellipses, "...", and choose `"New with options"`.

- Keep the defaults, but change the machine type to `4-core` and click `Create Codespace`.

Your Codespace is being created. After a few minutes, you will be able to see your Codespace in the browser.

### Step 3: Verify Copilot Functionality

#### Hello to Copilot

- Click on the Copilot icon on the left side of the screen to open the chat.

- Type `Hello` and press `Enter` to interact with Copilot.

## Optional Verification Steps

### Step 4: Verify the application runs

#### Run application

- Startup the application and verify the application is running.
- From the terminal window, navigate to the application folder: `cd ./WrightBrothersApi/WrightBrothersApi/`
- Run the application by typing the following command in the terminal:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter an error message like `Project file does not exist.` or `Couldn't find a project to run.`, it's likely that you're executing the command from an incorrect directory. To resolve this, navigate to the correct directory using the command `cd ./WrightBrothersApi`. If you need to move one level up in the directory structure, use the command `cd ..`. The corrcect directory is the one that contains the `WrightBrothersApi.csproj` file.

### Step 5: Verify calling the REST API

#### Rest Client Extension

The REST API client extension is very useful to quickly execute HTTP requests in your IDE and have all HTTP requests in source control.

- Open the `Examples/Flights.http` file, click `Send Request` to execute the `takeFlight` request.

    ```
        Send Request
    POST http://localhost:1903/flights/1/takeFlight/75 HTTP/1.1
    content-type: application/json
    ```

- You will see that the flight is taking off and the response is `200 OK`.

- Response will be:

    ```json
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: close
    ```

- Stop the application by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window.

#### Verify the unit tests

- From the terminal window, navigate to the project's root folder:

    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

- This is the folder that contains the `WrightBrothersApi.Tests` folder. If you're in the correct folder, when you type `tree -L 1` in the terminal, you should see the following output:

    ```
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ WrightBrothersApi
    â”œâ”€â”€ WrightBrothersApi.sln
    â””â”€â”€ WrightBrothersApi.Tests
    ```

- Run existing unit tests by typing the following command in the terminal:

    ```sh
    dotnet test
    ```

- The tests should run and pass.

    ```sh
    Starting test execution, please wait...
    A total of 1 test files matched the specified pattern.
    Passed!  - Failed:  0, Passed:  1, Skipped:  0, Total:  1
    ```

### Congratulations you've made it to the end! &#9992;

#### And with that, you've now concluded this module. We hope you enjoyed it! &#x1F60A;
