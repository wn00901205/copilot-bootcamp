# Lab 1.0 - Welcome Aboard: Introduction to AI and GitHub Copilot

This session offers a comprehensive overview of AI's evolution, key terms, and core technologies, explains Azure OpenAI's role in powering Copilot, uses analogies to link foundational AI concepts to Copilot, stresses ethical AI use, and provides strategies for effectively integrating AI tools in coding.

## Objectives

- Warm-up session with a brief introduction to AI and GitHub Copilot.
- An analogy between GitHub Copilot and an airplane's copilot: assisting the pilot (developer) in navigating the skies (coding challenges).

#### Welcome Aboard!

Welcome to the Copilot Bootcamp, where we embark on an exciting journey in the world of coding, guided by GitHub Copilot, our trusty navigator much like an airplane's copilot. Imagine yourself as a pilot, akin to the pioneering Wright Brothers, stepping into the cockpit of modern software development. GitHub Copilot, your co-pilot, is there to assist you in navigating the vast and often turbulent skies of coding challenges.

Just as the Wright Brothers revolutionized travel by mastering the skies, GitHub Copilot is set to revolutionize coding by harnessing the power of AI. In this bootcamp, you'll learn how to seamlessly integrate GitHub Copilot into your coding practice, allowing it to guide you through complex codebases, offer real-time suggestions, and help troubleshoot tricky segments of code, much like a copilot would assist in navigating difficult flight paths.

As you become more proficient with GitHub Copilot, you'll find it's not just an assistant but a co-creator, propelling your projects forward with the speed and precision that would make the Wright Brothers proud. This bootcamp is your runway to mastering this AI-powered tool, helping you soar to new heights in your coding endeavors.

#### Why is the copilot bootcamp aviation themed?

The aviation theme of the copilot bootcamp symbolizes innovation and breakthrough in development, akin to the Wright Brothers' revolution in aviation. It highlights how Copilot and generative AI tools is the next evolution in software engineering are pioneering a new era in software engineering, offering transformative ways for developers to interact with development processes.

#### A brief history of AI

- In 1956, the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined, marking the beginning of a new field of research aimed at creating machines capable of simulating human-like intelligence. The landscape of AI in 1956 was quite different from today due to limited technological capabilities and computational resources.
- During the 1990s, the rise of the internet and the availability of big data significantly advanced machine learning methods.
- By 1997, Machine Learning had been evolving since the early days of AI research. The concept of ML involves creating algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns and make decisions from data, without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. A notable event occurred in 1997 in the realm of AI and game-playing, with IBM's Deep Blue defeating Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, in a chess match.
- In 2012, AlexNet's triumph in the ImageNet challenge, a prestigious competition in image classification and recognition, marked a turning point in deep learning, leading to its widespread adoption.
- By 2017, deep learning had become a prominent and transformative technique within the field of machine learning, particularly in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
- Also in 2017, Generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence focused on creating new content like text, images, and audio, was gaining significant attention and making strides in various creative and practical applications.
- In 2020, a research paper was written on GitHub Copilot to explore the possibilities of Generative AI.
- By 2021, Generative AI had been used to create new written, visual, and auditory content given prompts or existing data.
